    The _ViewStart.cshtml file is a special file and the code present in this file is going to be executed before the code in an individual view is executed (it allows to apply DRY concept).
    Here is defined what is the default master page for your app.
    If you want to explicitly define a different master page for a view, you can do so by defining it at the top.

    Layout = "_Layout";
