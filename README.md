## Description
My first project with [ASP.NET Core 6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-6.0?view=aspnetcore-6.0) leaving from the basics structure to build a simple CRUD website.

- [Areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-6.0)  to organize related functionality.
- Conventional and attribute routing with combination of constraints.
