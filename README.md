# .Net Core 6 - School Stage

## Description
My first project with [ASP.NET Core 6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-6.0?view=aspnetcore-6.0) leaving from the basics structure to build a simple CRUD website.

### Topics covered

- New program style with implicit `using` directives.
- Leaving Startup.cs, the content of these methods is now coded into Program.cs
  - ConfigureServices() for registration services for dependency injection, and
  - Configure(), to delineate the order and structure of the middleware pipeline.
- Conventional routing with combination of constraints
- Use and extension of Tag helpers and Data Annotations Attributes.
- Client side libraries integrity.
- Use of [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/slate/) theme.
- Toaster and jQuery Validation as partial views.
